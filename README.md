# Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a full-stack web application that consists of a Spring Boot backend for creating a RESTful API and a React.js frontend for consuming that API. The project offers a robust solution for managing employee data with essential CRUD features:

- Create Employee
- List Employee
- Update Employee
- Delete Employee
- View Employee Details

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main components:

1. **Spring Boot Backend (server):**
   - Developed in Java, the Spring Boot backend is responsible for creating a REST API that handles all interactions with employee data.
   - It provides endpoints for creating, listing, updating, and deleting employee records.
   - Utilizes Spring Data JPA for database operations and exposes RESTful APIs using Spring MVC.

2. **React Frontend (client):**
   - The React.js frontend serves as the user interface for managing employee information.
   - It consumes the REST API provided by the backend to display and interact with employee data.
   - Utilizes Axios for making API requests and Bootstrap for a responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** A Java-based framework for building robust and scalable backend services.
- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **MySQL:** A relational database management system used for storing employee data.
- **Axios:** A JavaScript library for making asynchronous API requests.
- **Bootstrap:** A popular CSS framework for creating responsive web designs.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up and running the project, ensure you have the following software and resources:

- **JDK 17:** Install Java Development Kit 11 or higher.
- **Node.js:** Install Node.js to run the frontend.
- **MySQL:** Set up a MySQL database and configure the connection details in the backend `application.properties` file.


## Usage

- Use the web interface to manage employees, including creating new records, editing existing details, and searching for specific employees.
- The Spring Boot backend provides the necessary APIs for performing CRUD operations on employee data.
